I’m Srikanth — a DevOps and Infrastructure Architect passionate about empowering engineering teams through automation, security, and scalable systems.

Over the years, I’ve helped organizations—from startups to enterprise—build cloud-native platforms that are resilient, efficient, and developer-friendly. Whether it’s designing infrastructure-as-code pipelines, optimizing CI/CD workflows, or scaling Kubernetes clusters, I’m all about turning complex systems into reliable, automated solutions that engineering teams love to use.

This blog is my space to share insights, battle-tested tips, and lessons learned from the trenches of DevOps, cloud infrastructure, and platform engineering.

Let’s build smarter, safer, and faster—together.
